## What I do

I'm a software engineer and trained computer scientist (BS from Colorado School of Mines). I build software systems from the ground up to help solve difficult problems. I use [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Python](http://www.python.org/), [Java](http://www.java.com/en/), [Javascript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), and any other languages that get thrown my way ([C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/), [Scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29), and [Perl](http://www.perl.org/) are a few of the others I've dabbled in). I like building with these frameworks: [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Dropwizard](http://dropwizard.codahale.com/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/). And I love use these technologies: [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/), [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/), [Redis](http://redis.io/), [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/), [Storm](http://storm-project.net/). 

A few other technologies I've enjoyed dipping my toes into are [D3](http://d3js.org/), [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/), [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/). 

I like running my software on hosted hardware with companies like [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/), and [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/) to help ease DevOps. 

All in all, I try to play with and understand as many aspects of technology as I can, including the humans that build it. I've been a part of a men's group for three and a half years, and have studied Buddhism, human emotions, relationships, and human behavior in my spare time over the last 4-5 years as well. I love trying to understand how humans affect and are affected by the technologies we build. 


## What I've Done

I started programming in high school when I received a Java book from a friend. My mentors Jay Craig and Terry Healey walked me through my first steps in understand how to talk with computers back in 2000-2003. 

I don't remember precisely why I chose to go to Colorado School of Mines, but I do remember it being the only school I applied to. It turned out to be a great fit for me. It provided me the opportunity to dive deep into the tools of modern science, computer science and software engineering, learning calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, chemistry, physics, data structures, operating systems, compilers, algorithms, parallel computing, etc. I loved it. Ate it up. 

I did some **internships**:  

*Tyler* (January 2006 - May 2006)

I learned a lot about large scale Java development and deployment at Tyler. They had a number of applications that all utilized a number of common in-house libraries. I worked on building out a prototype upgrade application for the applications built on top of those libraries that would figure out the new dependencies it needed, and just download the libraries that had been upgraded. 

*Northrop Grumman* (May 2006 - August 2006)

I got a security clearance and made good money as a intern. That about sums up what I did and learned there. Oh, and that I don't like huge beaucratic companies. 

*Spatial* (May 2005 - August 2005, January 2007 - October 2007)

My time at Spatial with [Kevin Tatterson](www.linkedin.com/pub/kevin-tatterson/5/555/946/) and [Jeff Happoldt](www.linkedin.com/pub/jeff-happoldt/11/9a2/1a4) really helped cement some of the things I learned in operating systems from [Mike Colagrosso](http://colagrosso.net/) and from my badass professor, mentor, and boss [Lars Nyland](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/lars-nyland/12/610/7b3) (Those two were some of my best professors at CSM). Memory allocation, performance concerns and testing, assembly code and what it means, numerical optimizations, etc.

###Out into industry

As I was finishing up my degree I found myself very ready (chomping at the bit, you might say) to apply it to the world of startups. Which brought me to Socialthing.

*Socialthing* (June 2007 - August 2008)

At Socialthing we built a social media aggregator. You could log in as a user, and see all of your friend's activity, across all of your social networks, in one place. We built it in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and Javascript in the browser. We got acquired by AOL in August of 2008 and were brought on to build our technology out on their stack. We helped with the Bebo news feed, adding data from Twitter, Flickr, etc. to the stream. And we then went on to build what has become the AOL Lifestream.

*SimpleGeo* (February 2010 - February 2011)

I left AOL in January 2010 to take a bit of time off and join [SimpleGeo](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/simplegeo), [Matt Galligan](http://mgalligan.com/)'s next startup. I spent the next year helping all over the place, in the API, helping manage the developer team as it grew from 7 developers to over a dozen, and doing website work with [Jeffrey Kalmikoff](http://www.callmejeffrey.com) and Jon Rohan. As I said, all over the place. Fun, fast-paced. Great team. I left in February 2011, not quite ready to make the jump to San Francisco, as the company transitioned all of its resources there.

*Contracting* (May 2011 - Present)

Since then, I've been doing software engineering contracting as well as doing a lot of personal development and self-understanding. I went through a divorce during 2011 and 2012, and, in many ways, have had my world ripped open. That's a beautiful, powerful, scary, and incredibly necessary part of life, I'm finding. This process has helped me learn so much about myself and what I am made of... and has me continually excited for the future.

*callisto.fm / Epic Playground* (June 2012 - September 2012)

I also had a brief period (June-September 2012) as VP of engineering at [callisto.fm](http://callisto.fm), which has become [Epic Playground](http://www.epicplayground.com/), helping design their architecture and guide that team. Ultimately, we weren't the right fit, and through that process I learned a lot about what I'm capable of, and what I want to do and how I want to be in the world.
