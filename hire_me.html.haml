  I bring a thoughtful, empathetic approach to software development.

  I love to learn and discover. To explore a problem space and
  understand the nooks and crannies of it.

  I love to play with the pixels on the front page, and to tune an
  algorithm on the back end. It all matters. It all serves to help solve
  a problem, a user need, a business need.

  I love to geek out. I studied quantum mechanics and Bose-Einstein
  Condensates in college for the hell of it. I love reading academic
  papers, trying to discover the pieces that can help me solve a problem
  I have at a startup.

  I love to understand people, and how they interact to form teams. How
  to structure those teams so the members feel ownership of the product,
  and are productive. I love the energy of a group of people coming
  together to build something.

  I love to understand systems, from the big to the small. How each
  piece comes together to create a higher whole.

  I bring a thoughtful, empathetic approach to software development. I focus on how the product will affect the customer.
  
  My passion is to solve user problems, whether that is a pixel perfect implementation of a design, or that extra 10% speed improvement that makes an application fly. I love to fully understand technical systems, so that I know how to use them to solve real-world problems.
  
  I understand and can build and articulate complex computer systems in ways that anyone can understand. 
  
  **I've been writing code for 10 years**. I started when I was sixteen, learning Java from a book a friend gave me, and from my mentors, Jay Craig and Terry Healey. 

  I started my computer science education in earnest at Colorado School of Mines in 2003. I was the sophomore in the senior classes, along with my friend [Wade Simmons](http://wades.im/mons/). I studied operating system, compilers, high performance systems, distributed systems, graphics, and algorithms. 
  
  My love of learning has permeated my software development career. I was the sophomore taking the senior classes. I worked with a physics professor, to do research on Bose-Einstein Condensates (which are a fascinating physical phenomena, you should check 'em out!).
  
  I've played with all sorts of systems: web, desktop, graphics, high-performance computing. 
  
  I cut my teeth on C++ and Java in school, and extended that learning while interning at Tyler Technologies (in their [Eagle Product](http://www.tylertech.com/solutions-products/eagle-product-suite) division), and [Spatial](http://www.spatial.com/). 
  
  At Spatial I built a performance timing system, and ported a few million lines of C++ to a new version of GCC on the Mac (numerical optimizations get *really* interesting to debug in production code...), and tested a new memory allocation system for the ACIS geometric kernel. 
  
  I had an amazing professor, [Lars Nyland](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/lars-nyland/12/610/7b3), who let me hang out and code in his labs (and paid me for it!). While working with Lars, I wrote a n-body simulation in C++, which was then rendered in the Thunder Graphics Lab (an immersive, interactive 3D environment). 
  
  After finishing at CSM, I dove straight into the startup scene in Boulder, beginning at Socialthing. I worked on all technical aspects of that product, working in Ruby and Rails, and playing in HTML and Javascript in the browser. 
  
  In August 2008, Socialthing was acquired by AOL, and the Socialthing engineering team began to port
