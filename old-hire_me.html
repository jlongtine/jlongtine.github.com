<p>I bring a thoughtful, empathetic approach to software development.</p>

<p>I love to learn and discover. To explore a problem space and
understand the nooks and crannies of it.</p>

<p>I love to play with the pixels on the front page, and to tune an
algorithm on the back end. It all matters. It all serves to help solve
a problem, a user need, a business need.</p>

<p>I love to geek out. I studied quantum mechanics and Bose-Einstein
Condensates in college for the hell of it. I love reading academic
papers, trying to discover the pieces that can help me solve a problem
I have at a startup.</p>

<p>I love to understand people, and how they interact to form teams. How
to structure those teams so the members feel ownership of the product,
and are productive. I love the energy of a group of people coming
together to build something.</p>

<p>I love to understand systems, from the big to the small. How each
piece comes together to create a higher whole.</p>

<p>I bring a thoughtful, empathetic approach to software development. I focus on how the product will affect the customer.</p>

<p>My passion is to solve user problems, whether that is a pixel perfect implementation of a design, or that extra 10% speed improvement that makes an application fly. I love to fully understand technical systems, so that I know how to use them to solve real-world problems.</p>

<p>I understand and can build and articulate complex computer systems in ways that anyone can understand.</p>

<p><strong>I've been writing code for 10 years</strong>. I started when I was sixteen, learning Java from a book a friend gave me, and from my mentors, Jay Craig and Terry Healey.</p>

<p>I started my computer science education in earnest at Colorado School of Mines in 2003. I was the sophomore in the senior classes, along with my friend <a href="http://wades.im/mons/">Wade Simmons</a>. I studied operating system, compilers, high performance systems, distributed systems, graphics, and algorithms.</p>

<p>My love of learning has permeated my software development career. I was the sophomore taking the senior classes. I worked with a physics professor, to do research on Bose-Einstein Condensates (which are a fascinating physical phenomena, you should check 'em out!).</p>

<p>I've played with all sorts of systems: web, desktop, graphics, high-performance computing.</p>

<p>I cut my teeth on C++ and Java in school, and extended that learning while interning at Tyler Technologies (in their <a href="http://www.tylertech.com/solutions-products/eagle-product-suite">Eagle Product</a> division), and <a href="http://www.spatial.com/">Spatial</a>.</p>

<p>At Spatial I built a performance timing system, and ported a few million lines of C++ to a new version of GCC on the Mac (numerical optimizations get <em>really</em> interesting to debug in production code...), and tested a new memory allocation system for the ACIS geometric kernel.</p>

<p>I had an amazing professor, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/lars-nyland/12/610/7b3">Lars Nyland</a>, who let me hang out and code in his labs (and paid me for it!). While working with Lars, I wrote a n-body simulation in C++, which was then rendered in the Thunder Graphics Lab (an immersive, interactive 3D environment).</p>

<p>After finishing at CSM, I dove straight into the startup scene in Boulder, beginning at Socialthing. I worked on all technical aspects of that product, working in Ruby and Rails, and playing in HTML and Javascript in the browser.</p>

<p>In August 2008, Socialthing was acquired by AOL, and the Socialthing engineering team began to port</p>
